# HTML

- Create score and highscore

# JS

- Add functionality to html
- Reset click event
- Guess click event
- Score decresse if guess is wrong
- Keep higscore
- Make secret number go from 0 to 20 - OK!
- Text change if guess is higher or lower than secret number
- Win screen if you guess correct
- Loose screen if you run out of points

- Logic of game when guess button is clicked if number input is empty it should ask for a input again, if number === secret number games stops and winner message and screen appears, if number !== secret number it says if number is less or more than secret number game is played untill score is less than 1 and loosing screen apears.
